WHEREAS, Capital Provider desires to provide capital to InvestoFund for the specific purpose of funding MCAs, in exchange for a share of the profits generated from such MCAs, in accordance with the terms herein;

AND WHEREAS, both parties acknowledge that this Agreement constitutes a profit-sharing arrangement, not a loan or debt instrument, and does not convey any ownership or management rights in InvestoFund to the Capital Provider.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and promises herein contained, the parties agree as follows:

1. Capital Contribution and Purpose
a. Capital Provider agrees to provide InvestoFund with a capital contribution in the amount of [Amount, e.g., Ten Thousand Dollars ($10,000.00)] (the "Contributed Capital").
b. The Contributed Capital shall be used solely for the purpose of funding one or more MCAs originated and underwritten by InvestoFund.
c. Return of Unused Capital: If any portion of the Contributed Capital is not deployed into a specific MCA within sixty (60) calendar days of its receipt by InvestoFund, that unused portion shall be returned to the Capital Provider within five (5) business days thereafter.

a. In consideration for the Contributed Capital, Capital Provider shall be entitled to fifty percent (50%) of the "Net Receivable Profit" generated from each MCA that is directly funded by the Capital Provider's Contributed Capital.
b. "Net Receivable Profit" is defined for the purpose of this Agreement as: The Total Repayment received by InvestoFund from the Merchant, MINUS the original Advance Amount provided to the Merchant, MINUS any ISO Commission paid by InvestoFund related to that specific MCA.
c. The remaining fifty percent (50%) of the Net Receivable Profit will be retained by InvestoFund to cover all of its operational expenses.

3. Distributions to Capital Provider
a. Distribution Event: Payments to the Capital Provider shall occur upon a "Distribution Event," which is defined as the full collection by InvestoFund of the Total Repayment from the Merchant for the specific MCA funded by the Capital Provider's Contributed Capital.

Welcome to InvestoFund!
Thank you for your interest in joining our platform. This packet will guide you through our process and what you can expect as an investor seeking high-yield alternative investments. At InvestoFund LLC (hereinafter, "InvestoFund"), our mission is to connect savvy investors like you with short-term, high-potential Merchant Cash Advance (MCA) opportunities, creating a powerful engine for passive income.

HOW IT WORKS: THE INVESTOR JOURNEY

You Contribute Capital: You make a capital contribution (starting at $5,000) to be deployed into our next available deal.

We Source & Vet Deals: Our expert team sources and performs rigorous due diligence on merchant applications submitted by our broker network.

Capital is Deployed: Your funds are used to purchase a portion of a merchant's future receivables at a discount. This is a commercial transaction, not a loan.

Receivables are Collected: Over an average of 45â€“60 days, we collect the purchased receivables from the merchant.

Profits are Split: Once the deal is complete, the net profits are split 50/50 between you and InvestoFund. Your principal and profits are returned to you.

EXAMPLE OF RETURNS

Your Capital Contribution: $10,000

Total Receivables Purchased: $13,500

Gross Profit: $3,500

Net Receivable Profit (after commissions): ~$3,000

Your 50% Share: ~$1,500

This example is for illustrative purposes only. Returns are not guaranteed. Please see our Profit Sharing Agreement for formal terms.

PREMIUM & DIVERSIFIED PRODUCTS

For investors contributing $25,000 or more, we offer:

Diversified Portfolios: Spread your capital across multiple vetted MCA deals to mitigate risk.

Enhanced Profit Split: Benefit from a 55/45 profit split in your favor.

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS (FAQ)

What is an MCA? It's a way for businesses to get capital by selling a portion of their future sales. It's faster and more flexible than a traditional loan.

What are the risks? The primary risk is merchant default. We mitigate this through careful underwriting and legal filings. Please review our full Risk Disclosure Summary.

Is my money locked up? Only for the short term of the deal (average 45 days). If we can't find a suitable deal within 60 days, we return your capital in full.

3. Risk Disclosure Summary
Document Purpose: A plain-English summary of key investment risks to ensure transparency.

Google Docs Formatting: Copy the text below. Use clear, bold headings.

SUMMARY OF KEY RISKS

This document provides a summary of the key risks associated with providing capital for Merchant Cash Advance (MCA) deals through InvestoFund LLC ("InvestoFund"). This is not an exhaustive list but covers the most critical factors. Investing in MCAs involves significant risk and is suitable only for investors who can bear the loss of their entire investment.

1. Merchant Default Risk

What it is: The primary risk is that a merchant's business fails or they otherwise cease operations, making them unable to generate the future receivables that were purchased.

How we mitigate it: Rigorous due diligence, analysis of bank statements, UCC-1 filings to secure our position, and personal guarantees on covenants.

2. MCA Recharacterization Risk

What it is: A court could potentially re-characterize an MCA transaction as a loan. If this happens, state usury laws (interest rate caps) could apply, potentially reducing the expected return or leading to penalties.

How we mitigate it: Our contracts are drafted by legal experts to ensure they are structured as the purchase of future assets, not a loan, with no fixed payment term.

3. Liquidity Risk

What it is: Your capital is illiquid (locked in) for the duration of the MCA deal. You cannot withdraw your funds during this period.

How we mitigate it: We focus on short-term deals and commit to returning any capital that is not deployed within 60 days.

4. Economic Downturn Impact

What it is: A broad economic recession could increase the rate of merchant defaults across all sectors, impacting the performance of your investment.

How we mitigate it: Industry diversification and increasingly stringent underwriting standards during times of economic uncertainty.

IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER
The investment opportunities offered by InvestoFund are not securities registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Returns are not guaranteed. Past performance does not guarantee future returns. InvestoFund does not provide legal, financial, or tax advice. Please consult with your professional advisors before providing capital.
