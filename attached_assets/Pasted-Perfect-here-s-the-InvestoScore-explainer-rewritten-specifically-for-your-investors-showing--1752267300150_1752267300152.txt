## 📊 Understanding the InvestoScore™

### The Core Metric Driving Deal Selection — and Investor Returns

The **InvestoScore™** is the **primary underwriting signal** used by the InvestoFund platform to determine which merchants are most likely to repay efficiently, communicate clearly, and support repeat investment cycles.

This score is what **investors see first** when reviewing a deal — and it serves as the **baseline indicator of deal strength, risk, and readiness**.

---

## ✅ Why the InvestoScore™ Matters to Investors

* **Confidence to participate or pass** on a deal
* **Risk-tier clarity** without requiring deep due diligence
* **Insight into merchant behavior** beyond the raw numbers
* **Alignment with fund strategy** — conservative investors can choose higher-score deals, while aggressive investors may pursue low-score/high-yield profiles
* **Longer-term compounding** — higher scores often lead to repeatable, lower-risk reinvestment cycles with trusted merchants

## 🔍 How the Score is Calculated

The InvestoScore™ is algorithmically generated and manually validated, factoring in:

| Metric                   | Description                                       |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| 📈 Repayment Behavior    | Consistency and early repayment improve score     |
| 🧾 Document Completeness | More verified financials = lower risk             |
| 💬 Communication History | Responsiveness, clarity, professionalism          |
| 💰 Cash Flow Trends      | Monthly revenue, deposit frequency, seasonality   |
| 📊 Deal Performance      | Previous funding through InvestoFund and outcomes |

Scores update in real time as new data is submitted or behavior evolves.

## 💼 How It Affects Your Portfolio

### Higher-Score Merchants Typically:

* Have stronger documentation
* Attract more contributor bids
* Get funded faster
* Have **higher reinvestment potential**
* Qualify for larger and longer-term offers over time

### Lower-Score Merchants:

* May offer higher yield
* Are generally higher risk
* Require stronger justification or special notes from underwriting

This **score-based approach** gives investors the ability to build a **diversified capital portfolio** around measurable performance indicators.

## 💸 Real Income, Repeatable Results

Many of the top-performing contributors on the InvestoFund platform fund:

* High-Score Merchants on a repeat cycle
* Deals with 30–180 day returns and clear payback logic
* Merchants who’ve graduated into larger tranches based on strong scores

This creates **compounding income cycles** from merchants with proven ability to repay and grow — not just one-time gains from riskier plays.
