InvestoFund PROFIT/REVENUE SHARING AGREEMENT FOR CAPITAL PROVIDERS
This Profit/Revenue Sharing Agreement (the "Agreement") is made and entered into as of this [Day] day of [Month], [Year] (the "Effective Date"), by and between:
[InvestoFund LLC/CORPORATION NAME], a [New York Limited Liability Company/Corporation], with its principal place of business at [InvestoFund Address] (hereinafter, "InvestoFund" or "Company");
AND
[Capital Provider Name], an individual residing at [Capital Provider Address] or entity located at [Capital Provider Address] (hereinafter, "Capital Provider").
WHEREAS, InvestoFund is engaged in the business of originating, funding, and managing Merchant Cash Advances ("MCAs") by purchasing future receivables from merchants; WHEREAS, InvestoFund seeks capital to fund such MCAs; WHEREAS, Capital Provider desires to provide capital to InvestoFund for the specific purpose of funding MCAs, in exchange for a share of the profits generated from such MCAs, in accordance with the terms herein; and WHEREAS, both parties acknowledge that this Agreement constitutes a profit-sharing arrangement, and not a loan or debt instrument, nor does it convey any ownership or management rights in InvestoFund to the Capital Provider.
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and promises herein contained, the parties agree as follows:
1. Capital Contribution and Purpose. a. Capital Provider agrees to provide InvestoFund with a capital contribution in the amount of Five Thousand Dollars ($5,000.00) or more (the "Contributed Capital"), as agreed upon for each specific MCA opportunity. b. The Contributed Capital shall be used solely for the purpose of funding Merchant Cash Advances originated and underwritten by InvestoFund. c. Return of Unused Capital: If any portion of the Contributed Capital is not deployed into a specific MCA within sixty (60) calendar days of its receipt by InvestoFund, that unused portion shall be returned to the Capital Provider within [e.g., 5] business days thereafter.
2. Profit Sharing. a. In consideration for the Contributed Capital, Capital Provider shall be entitled to fifty percent (50%) of the "Net Receivable Profit" generated from each MCA that is directly funded by the Capital Provider's Contributed Capital. b. "Net Receivable Profit" for the purpose of this Agreement is defined as: * The Total Repayment received by InvestoFund from the Merchant (Advance Amount x Factor Rate) * MINUS the original Advance Amount provided to the Merchant * MINUS any ISO Commission paid by InvestoFund related to that specific MCA (as defined in the ISO Agreement). c. Capital Provider acknowledges that InvestoFund will be responsible for all other operational expenses of InvestoFund and that the remaining 50% of the Net Receivable Profit will be retained by InvestoFund.
3. Distributions to Capital Provider. a. Distribution Event: Payments to the Capital Provider shall occur upon a "Distribution Event," which is defined as the full collection by InvestoFund of the Total Repayment from the Merchant for the specific MCA funded by the Capital Provider's Contributed Capital. b. Distribution Schedule: InvestoFund shall disburse the Capital Provider's share of the Net Receivable Profit to the Capital Provider within [e.g., 5] business days following each Distribution Event. c. Capital Provider acknowledges that repayment schedules for MCAs vary, and therefore, the timing of distributions will directly correspond to the actual collection of receivables from merchants. InvestoFund commits to providing prompt payouts as funds are collected.
4. Passive Role of Capital Provider. a. Capital Provider acknowledges and agrees that this Agreement constitutes a passive investment. The Capital Provider shall have no right, power, or authority to manage, direct, control, or participate in the operations, management, or business decisions of InvestoFund, including but not limited to, underwriting, funding decisions, collections, or legal actions. b. InvestoFund shall maintain sole discretion and control over all aspects of its business operations.
5. Investor Exit & Company's Right to Terminate. a. Capital Provider's Exit: The Capital Provider may request the return of their Contributed Capital (minus any outstanding balance on MCAs currently funded by that capital) at any time by providing InvestoFund with [e.g., 30] days' written notice. InvestoFund will endeavor to return the Capital Provider's initial Contributed Capital promptly as soon as the specific MCAs funded by that capital are fully repaid. b. InvestoFund's Right to Terminate: InvestoFund reserves the right to terminate this Agreement and return the Capital Provider's Contributed Capital (plus all accrued and undistributed Net Receivable Profits) to the Capital Provider at any time after the Capital Provider has received distributions totaling their initial Contributed Capital plus an additional [e.g., 100%] in Net Receivable Profits (i.e., a 2x return on their initial capital), or after [e.g., 12 months] from the Effective Date, whichever occurs first, by providing [e.g., 30] days' written notice to the Capital Provider.
6. Reporting and Transparency. a. InvestoFund shall provide the Capital Provider with regular updates (e.g., monthly) on the status of MCAs funded by the Capital Provider's Contributed Capital, including repayment progress and upcoming distributions. b. InvestoFund commits to utilizing efficient tracking systems to ensure transparency in reporting and timely payouts.
7. Representations and Warranties of Capital Provider. a. Capital Provider represents and warrants that they are providing funds from legitimate sources and are not engaging in any unlawful activity. b. Capital Provider understands and acknowledges that this is a high-risk investment and that the return of Contributed Capital and profits is contingent upon the successful collection of MCAs from merchants, which carries inherent risks, including merchant default. c. Capital Provider understands that this is a private placement and the interest herein has not been registered under any securities laws.
8. Governing Law & Dispute Resolution. a. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, without regard to its conflict of laws principles. b. Any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or the breach, termination, or invalidity thereof, shall first be subject to good faith negotiation. If negotiation fails, the parties agree to resolve the dispute through binding arbitration administered by [e.g., JAMS or AAA] in [New York, NY] in accordance with its then-current rules for commercial disputes. The decision of the arbitrator(s) shall be final and binding upon both parties.
9. Entire Agreement. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the Parties and supersedes all prior discussions, agreements, and understandings, whether oral or written.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Parties hereto have executed this Agreement as of the Effective Date.
