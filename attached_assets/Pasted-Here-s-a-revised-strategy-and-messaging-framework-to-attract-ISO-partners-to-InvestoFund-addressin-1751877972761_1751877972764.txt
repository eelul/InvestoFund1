Here‚Äôs a revised strategy and messaging framework to attract ISO partners to InvestoFund ‚Äî addressing common frustrations and clearly positioning your offer as the superior choice.

## üéØ Tailored Messaging to Attract ISOs

### 1. **Understand ISO Pain Points**

**From Reddit & industry reports**: brokers frequently voice frustration that their deals get rejected due to **narrow funder criteria**, **lack of relationships**, and the need to **share commissions** when partnering with others ([reddit.com][1]).

#### Example ISO Feedback:

> ‚ÄúSome funders aren‚Äôt keen on deals I bring‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs like fitting a square peg in a round hole.‚Äù ([reddit.com][1])
> ‚ÄúLead generation is expensive‚Ä¶ many people think it‚Äôs the mortgage business‚Äîit‚Äôs not.‚Äù ([debanked.com][2])

**Result:** ISOs are looking for funders who can handle diverse deal profiles, streamline funding, and offer clear, consistent incentives.
