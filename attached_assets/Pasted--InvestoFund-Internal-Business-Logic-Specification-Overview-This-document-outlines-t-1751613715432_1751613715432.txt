## üìÖ Deal Terms (Default)

| Term             | Value                           |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Factor Rate      | 1.49                            |
| Average Term     | 45 Days                         |
| ISO Commission   | 15% (default)                   |
| Profit Split     | 50% Investor / 50% Fund         |
| Net ROI per Deal | \~20.8%                         |
| Portfolio Option | Diversification starts at \$25K |

## üí≤ Investor Deal Flow Logic

### 1. Investment Input

* Minimum investment: \$5,000
* Investments > \$25,000 trigger optional **portfolio diversification**
* Capital is placed in a funding queue and matched to MCA opportunities

### 2. Deal Calculation

```js
repayment = investment * factorRate;
grossProfit = repayment - investment;
isoCommission = grossProfit * 0.15;
netProfit = grossProfit - isoCommission;
investorShare = netProfit * 0.50;
roi = investorShare / investment;
```

### 3. Diversified Portfolio Logic (Premium Option)

* Investor opts into a multi-deal allocation
* InvestoFund management fee: 10% of net profit
* Investor/Fund split: **45% / 55%**
* Enhanced risk mitigation

```js
investorShare = netProfit * 0.45;
```

### 4. Reinvestment Rules

* Default: Reinvest enabled
* Capital reinvested after deal maturity (\~45 days)
* Idle capital returned if not matched in 60 days
* Opt-out reinvestment toggle must be selected manually

### 5. Annualized ROI Estimate

```js
perDealROI * 8  // Approx. 8 cycles/year
```

## üìà Broker / ISO Logic

### 1. Deal Submission Types

| Type          | Requirements                | Commission |
| ------------- | --------------------------- | ---------- |
| Full          | All docs, underwritten      | 15%        |
| Partial       | Incomplete docs / weak file | 8-12%      |
| Fraud/Flagged | Fake docs / ghost merchant  | 0% + flag  |

### 2. Commission Adjustment Logic

```js
commissionBase = grossProfit * 0.15;
qualityMultiplier = 1 (full), 0.8 (partial), 0 (fraud);
finalCommission = commissionBase * qualityMultiplier;
```

### 3. Broker Incentives

* Volume bonuses: +1-2% if ISO funds 5+ deals/month
* Early access to high-quality leads for top ISOs

## üöÄ Reinvestment & Portfolio Behavior

### Reinvestment Options

* Auto reinvest enabled unless opted out
* Reinvestment triggers upon payout confirmation
* Can be paused or capped manually

### Diversification Mechanics

* For investments > \$25K
* Split across 2-10 MCA deals
* No single deal exceeds 25% of portfolio value
