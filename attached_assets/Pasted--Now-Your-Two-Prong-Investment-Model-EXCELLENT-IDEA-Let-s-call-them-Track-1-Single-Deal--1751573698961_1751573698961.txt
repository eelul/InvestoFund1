🔀 Now — Your Two-Prong Investment Model (EXCELLENT IDEA)
Let’s call them:

🟩 Track 1: Single Deal Investment ("Direct Deal Participation")
$5K minimum (or more)

You’re in one deal, with a clear timeline, clear return

Fully underwritten and disclosed

Simple, high-clarity, and higher return variability

🟨 Track 2: Diversified Deal Participation ("Portfolio Blend")
$25K minimum recommended

Your funds are spread across multiple deals (e.g., 10× $2.5K)

Returns vary slightly by deal (e.g., factor 1.29–1.49)

We pay based on average yield of the portfolio

Lower volatility, more passive, but requires more capital

🔁 Choose Your Investment Strategy
🟩 Option 1: Direct Deal Participation
Invest into a single, fully-underwritten MCA deal. This is our most direct investment option, with clear timelines and predictable returns.

Highlights:

Minimum Investment: $5,000

Standard factor rate: 1.45x–1.49x

Deal timeline: 25–60 days

Underwriting includes:

Bank statement analysis

UCC search & lien analysis

Owner background checks

Seasonality & cash flow forecast review

Merchant interview & reference check

You receive 50% of net profits on deal completion

🟨 Option 2: Portfolio Blend (Diversified Participation)
We allocate your funds across multiple active MCA deals. This reduces risk exposure while maintaining yield — based on the average performance of your portfolio.

Highlights:

Minimum Investment: $25,000

Each deal receives a slice (e.g., $2,500 × 10 deals)

Payouts based on average yield across all placements

Factor rates may range from 1.29–1.49 depending on deal type

Returns are consistent but slightly lower than single-deal highs

Great for passive investors who want diversification

ℹ️ Our underwriting always aims to maximize returns within the constraints of each merchant’s capacity, cash flow, and risk score — ensuring a healthy balance of safety and yield.
