## 📊 What is the InvestoScore™ — And Why It Matters

The **InvestoScore™** is the **primary metric used by InvestoFund contributors** to determine whether or not to fund a deal.

It reflects how reliable, stable, and fundable your business appears based on real data — not just a credit score.

When a deal is submitted to the fund, the InvestoScore™ is the first thing investors see.
They use it to evaluate:

* Risk
* Speed to return
* Confidence in the business owner
* And whether to participate in the offer

In short: **a strong InvestoScore™ often means faster approvals, better terms, and more funding participation. A weak or incomplete score leads to passed deals or delays.**

## 🧾 How to Raise Your InvestoScore™

The InvestoScore™ is based on real behavior, documentation, and interaction history. Merchants can **improve their score** by submitting more verified information and maintaining strong communication.

To increase your InvestoScore™, provide as many of the following as possible:

### ✅ Essential Documents

* 3 to 6 months of business bank statements
* Voided check or official bank letter
* Government-issued photo ID
* Business entity documents (EIN, Articles of Incorporation, DBA certificate)

### 🔁 Additional Documents That Boost Your Score

* Year-to-date profit & loss statement
* Balance sheet (if available)
* Most recent business tax return
* Copies of invoices or contracts tied to upcoming receivables
* Equipment lists or inventory purchase orders
* Lease agreement (if retail or warehouse based)

Each document helps confirm stability and legitimacy — making the business more attractive to investors.

## 📈 What a Higher Score Unlocks

A stronger InvestoScore™ improves:

* Speed to fund (less back-and-forth, quicker underwriting)
* Confidence from multiple contributors (more bids = better pricing)
* Eligibility for longer terms, lower costs, and larger approvals
* Priority placement in re-funding scenarios
