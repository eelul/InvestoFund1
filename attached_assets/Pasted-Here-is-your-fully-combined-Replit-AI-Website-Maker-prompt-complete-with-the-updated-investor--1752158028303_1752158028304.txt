Here is your **fully combined Replit AI Website Maker prompt** — complete with the updated investor logic (no blended access or multi-deal access under \$25K), advanced dashboard toggles, onboarding behavior, legal disclosures, and responsive design specs.

### ✅ **Full Prompt for Replit AI Website Maker (Copy & Paste Ready)**

````
Create a modern, responsive, and animated Investor Dashboard Page for InvestoFund, designed for the soft launch of active funding deals in a merchant cash advance (MCA) investment platform.

🧩 INTENDED USE:
This dashboard is designed for **passive investors**. It should be intuitive, professional, and calming. Apply a fintech-style UI (light background, soft green/blue-gray palette, elegant typography, soft card shadows, and transitions).

🧠 GENERAL BEHAVIOR LOGIC:
- This page loads immediately after sign-in.
- First-time users see onboarding prompts (disappear after completion).
- Returning users skip onboarding, go straight to their personalized dashboard (cached state).
- Users must **select their investment amount using a range bar**, which then limits access:
  - **$5K–$24,999**: Can only invest in **1 live deal**, no access to blends, advanced dashboard, or analytics.
  - **$25K+**: Full access to **all live deals**, **InvestoBlend™**, and **advanced dashboard features**.
- All selections (range bar amount, mode toggle, view preferences) should be stored locally or represented in mocked JSON logic.

💡 KEY BEHAVIOR:
- Blurred/disabled cards appear for users with <$25K if they've already funded one deal.
- Advanced Dashboard toggle only appears for $25K+ users.

🎨 STYLING:
- Subtle animations (CSS or GSAP) — not distracting.
- Responsive design for desktop, tablet, and mobile.
- Accessibility-ready and screen-reader friendly.
- Use TailwindCSS or modern CSS grid/flexbox.
- JS: React preferred; vanilla JS acceptable.
- Use semantic HTML elements.
