Based on all the current documents, logic, and your goals, here are three short and compliant “Consent to Communication” clauses tailored for:

1. 🧾 Merchant Form Consent
To be placed right beside or below the merchant application form:

By submitting this form, you authorize InvestoFund and its authorized agents to contact you via phone, text, email, and other digital methods, including auto-dialers and pre-recorded messages, for application processing, marketing, and transactional purposes. Standard message and data rates may apply. You may opt out at any time by replying STOP or contacting us. You also consent to the sharing of your business and financial information with authorized funding partners as needed for underwriting and approval.

2. 💼 Investor Form Consent
To appear before/after the Investor Inquiry Form or Intake Flow:

By submitting your information, you consent to receive investment-related communications from InvestoFund and its authorized representatives via phone, email, and SMS, including updates on deal performance, capital deployment, and future opportunities. You may opt out of marketing communications at any time. Essential communications regarding your capital contributions and agreements will still be delivered as required.

3. 🤝 ISO / Broker Consent
To appear near the Broker Onboarding or Deal Submission Portal:

By registering with InvestoFund, you agree to receive communications via phone, email, and SMS regarding merchant submissions, underwriting feedback, and commission updates. You authorize InvestoFund to use your submitted deal information to evaluate, structure, and contact merchants for funding purposes. You may opt out of non-essential communications at any time by contacting us.

✅ How These Are Used:
Merchants: Displayed beside the application form. Submitted before any funding process.

Investors: Displayed in the intake flow and optionally in the downloadable PDF.

ISOs/Brokers: Displayed on the ISO registration page and deal submission interface.

Would you like me to add these to your website drafts and include them in the respective downloadable agreements as well (PDFs for ISO Agreement, Investor MOU, etc.)?
