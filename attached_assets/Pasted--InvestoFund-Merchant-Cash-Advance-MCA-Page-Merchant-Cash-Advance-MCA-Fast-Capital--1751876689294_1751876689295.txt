## Merchant Cash Advance (MCA): Fast Capital, Flexible Repayment

### What is a Merchant Cash Advance?

A **Merchant Cash Advance (MCA)** is a financing solution that gives your business a lump sum of capital today — in exchange for a portion of your future sales. It’s not a loan, but an advance on future revenue. MCAs are ideal for businesses that need quick funding without the hassle of traditional loan requirements.

Whether you experience seasonal dips, sudden expenses, or rapid opportunities for growth, an MCA helps you move fast and stay in control.

### How Does an MCA Work?

* You receive a lump sum of working capital upfront.
* In return, you agree to repay the advance plus a fixed **factor rate** (no APR or compounding interest).
* Repayment is made through either:

  * A **fixed daily, weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly ACH withdrawal**, or
  * A **percentage of daily credit card or debit sales** (known as a holdback).

The repayment method is designed to align with your cash flow. Slower days mean smaller repayments, helping you manage operations smoothly.

### What’s the Difference Between a Loan and an MCA?

**Term Loan:**

* Fixed monthly payments
* Interest-bearing with a fixed or variable APR
* Longer approval times, often requires collateral and high credit scores

**Merchant Cash Advance:**

* Flexible, daily/weekly repayments
* Based on future sales, not collateral
* Quick approval and funding, even with lower credit

---

### MCA Holdback vs. Factor Rate

* **Holdback Rate:** The % of daily sales (credit/debit) used to repay the advance. This fluctuates with your revenue.
* **Factor Rate:** A one-time cost multiplier (e.g., 1.3 = 30% total repayment above principal). No APR or compound interest involved.

Example: \$100,000 advance × 1.3 factor rate = \$130,000 total repayment

### What Happens if You Default?

Failure to meet your MCA obligations can result in:

* Additional fees or penalties
* Collection activity or legal action (depending on your agreement)
* Business cash flow restrictions
* Possible personal guarantees (depending on structure)

If you’re struggling to meet payments, **contact InvestoFund early** to explore modification or consolidation options.
